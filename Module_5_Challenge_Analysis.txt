In this challenge we are asked to retrieve the statistical data for an animal study done over mice who were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens.

Here are three observations made from this statistical data:

- There are a total of 248 mice in this study. 51% being "Male" and "49%" being "Female".


- "Capomulin" and "Ramicane" seem to be the most effective treatment for the mice with SCC tumors over time. "Capomulin" and "Ramicane" had a lower "Final Tumor Volume" compared to "Infubinol" and "Ceftamin".

- There is a strong correlation between the "Average Tumor Volume" and the "Weight" for the entire "Capomulin" regimen.
